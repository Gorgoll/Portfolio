   <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
     I'm a 17-year-old student from Poland with a passion for computer games.
     My programming journey started at around 11 or 12 when I first explored game development using
     Roblox Studio, though I’m not a fan of it now.
     It was an exciting beginning that sparked my interest in technology, mainly in hardware.
     However, I don't really enjoy designing or working with hardware, which is why I switched to software.
     I would love to learn Arduino to kill two birds with one stone, but I mostly feel comfortable
     and enjoy making software (even though I’m not good at it yet).
     I believe that with time, enough persistence and motivation, I can improve.
    </p>
    <p>
     Although I didn’t accomplish much back then and lost touch with it for a while, I'm now eager to learn,
     gain experience, and create projects I'm proud of. I may not be the best at everything,
     but I always put in my best effort! 😅
    </p>
    <p>
     As for my personality, I really like to talk, and I'm always trying to make people's days better.
     I'm open to finding people I feel happy and comfortable around.
