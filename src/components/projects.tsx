   <h2>My Projects</h2>
   <p>
    So far, I've created several foundational projects that showcase my skills:
    <br/>
    - A Discord bot using a C# library with Spotify integration and database connection.
    <br/>
    - A simple Flappy Bird ripoff developed in C# using the Godot Engine.
    <br/>
    - And more simple side projects!
    <br/>
    While I've accomplished some basic projects,
    I plan to design a more polished template to showcase them in the future.
    However, I currently don't feel confident enough to present them as they are.
    That's why you can't find all of them on my GitHub!
